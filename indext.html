		<p>If you think your sport is hard, try doing it holding your breath. This quote describes exactly how difficult swimming is and how it is made all the more so because you have to hold your breath while pushing your body to its ultimate physical limits.</p>
		<p> I have been a member of a summer swim team since I was four years old and have swam competitively since the third grade. In high school I was a part of my school's competitive swim team, a team that ended up taking home four championship titles in the six years I was a member.</p>
		<p> Now, after properly establishing my credentials as a swimmer, I would like to give all who are reading this webpage some helpful tips on how to succeed in their own swimming careers. I will explain how to better swim the freestyle, seeing as it was my stroke during my swimming career. First, it is important to learn how to hold your breath for a longer than average amount of time- as illustrated by the cute little picture I have included in this webpage. Second, you must learn how to breath to the side. This will shave seconds off your record time!! Third, it is important to always remember to kick with a pointed toe and straight legs, which will help you glide through the water. I have also attached a table showing the fastest times and fastest swimmers of the 50 freestyle. If you remember these tips, you could very well one day see you name on this table!
